Installing and Using plugins
============================

This section talks about installing and using third party plugins.
For instructions on how to write your own plugins, please refer 
to :ref:`writing_plugins`.

There are two ways to install a third party plugin. From within flika,
you can open the Plugin Manager, select a plugin from the list, and 
press 'Install'. This will download the plugin into your ~/.FLIKA/plugins
directory. flika will import the plugin and you will be able to start using
it immediately.

If you are collaborating with a lab that has written a plugin that hasn't 
been submitted to the Plugin Manager, it is easy to manually add that plugin
to flika. Download the plugin, move it to the ~/.FLIKA/plugins directory and 
restart flika. That's all there is to it.
