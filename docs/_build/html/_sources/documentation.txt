Welcome to Flika's documentation!
=================================
Flika was created in the `Parker Lab <http://parkerlab.bio.uci.edu/index.htm>`_ in order to detect and measure |Ca2+| puffs caused by |IP3| channel openings.  It is growing into a general analysis tool for biological movies.

Flika currently supports .tif, .nd2, and .stk files.
