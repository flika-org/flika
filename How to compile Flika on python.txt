These instructions are for compiling Flika using PyInstaller. The end result will be a Windows-platform specific executable file that can be redistributed to users who don't have Python installed. If you would like to download the executable file go to http://flika-org.github.io/.


How to compile Flika on python

install PyInstaller with:
pip install pyinstaller

Navigate to the Flika directory.  Run 
pyi-makespec --icon=images/favicon.ico --additional-hooks-dir=. --hiddenimport leastsqbound flika.py

Then, because PyInstaller fails to import the numpy-mkl dlls, you have to add the hook-numpy file.  It is inside flika (more info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35478526/pyinstaller-numpy-intel-mkl-fatal-error-cannot-load-mkl-intel-thread-dll/36389023#36389023 given by j4n7). 

PyInstaller fails to import skimage._shared.transform, and the gui and images directories.  Open the flika.spec file and add the variable to the top of the file:

added_files=[
    ('gui','gui'),
    ('images','images')]

Then replace the line
    datas=None,
with
    datas = added_files,

Finally, run the following command
pyinstaller flika.spec

Then copy the skimage/_shared/transform.pyd to the dist/flika folder, renaming it skimage._shared.transform.pyd

You should now be able to double click on the flika.exe file and launch flika.
