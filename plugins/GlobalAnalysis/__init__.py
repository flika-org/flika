'''
This is an __init__ file for a FLIKA plugin
it must be located inside the subfolder to properly import the plugin

Also inside this folder:
	init.py : the file with a global 'menu' object that connects all the tools of this plugin
	all other .py files to be used in the plugin (must be imported with a . in front [Not sure why])

be sure to import global_vars as g

That's all
